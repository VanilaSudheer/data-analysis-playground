    "Welcome to the Python tutorial! This tutorial is designed to introduce you to the basics of Python programming language. Whether you're completely new to programming or looking to refresh your Python skills, you're in the right place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in various domains including web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Guido van Rossum started working on Python in the late 1980s, and the first version of CPython, Python 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. Since then, Guido van Rossum has been the primary author and maintainer of CPython for many years, overseeing its development and evolution into one of the most popular programming languages in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython continues to be developed and maintained by a community of contributors, with Guido van Rossum's guidance and involvement. It serves as the basis for the Python language specification and is the version of Python most commonly used by developers for building applications, libraries, and frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Python's success can be attributed to its simplicity, readability, versatility, and active community, making it a preferred language for both beginners and professionals in the world of programming.\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",

    "To begin our Python journey, let's start with some basics:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Classes**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects of the class will have. In Python, you can define a class using the **class** keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects (Instances)**: Objects are instances of classes. They are created based on the structure defined by the class. Each object has its own set of attributes and methods. You can create an object of a class by calling the class name followed by parentheses, like a function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes**: Attributes are data stored within a class or instance and represent the state or characteristics of the object. They are accessed using dot notation. In Python, attributes can be **instance variables** (belonging to each instance/object) or **class variables** (shared among all instances of the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods**: Methods are functions defined within a class. They define the behaviors or actions that objects of the class can perform. In Python, methods are defined using the def keyword within the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behavior from an existing class. The class being inherited from is called the base class or superclass, and the class inheriting from it is called the derived class or subclass. In Python, you can specify the **superclass in parentheses after the class name**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes a public interface for interacting with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows **methods to be called on objects without knowing their specific class**, and the appropriate method is called based on the actual class of the object. Polymorphism in Python is achieved through **method overriding and method overloading**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Abstract Base Classes (ABCs):Abstract base classes are classes that define abstract methods which must be implemented by their subclasses. They cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "ABCs are used to define a common interface or set of methods that subclasses are expected to implement.\n",
    "The **abc.ABC** class is the base class for defining ABCs.  \n",
    "Defining Abstract Methods:Abstract methods are methods declared in an abstract base class but not implemented in the base class itself.Subclasses of the abstract base class must provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.\n",
    "Abstract methods are defined using the **@abstractmethod** decorator from the abc module.  \n",
    "Enforcing Method Implementations:When a subclass of an abstract base class fails to implement one or more abstract methods defined in the base class, it raises a TypeError at runtime.This ensures that all subclasses of the abstract base class provide concrete implementations for the required methods.  \n",
    "Interface Checking:The abc module also provides functions like **isinstance() and issubclass()** which can be used to check whether an object is an instance of a particular abstract base class or whether a class is a subclass of an abstract base class.\n",
    "This allows for interface checking, ensuring that objects and classes conform to the specified interface defined by the abstract base class.  \n",
    "**Abstract Class: A class is considered abstract if it has one or more abstract methods.  \n",
    "Concrete Class: A class is considered concrete if it implements all abstract methods defined in itself and its parent classes.  \n",
    "Instantiation: Only concrete classes can be instantiated. If a class (or any of its parent classes) has unimplemented abstract methods, it cannot be instantiated directly.**"

    "Metaclasses are often used for advanced purposes such as enforcing class-level constraints, adding methods or attributes to classes dynamically, and implementing custom behavior for class instantiation.  \n",
    "Class-Level Constraints: Metaclasses can enforce class-level constraints by intercepting the creation of classes \n",

    "In many cases, decorators can achieve similar results with simpler syntax.\n",
    "It's important to choose the appropriate tool (metaclass or decorator) based on the requirements and complexity of the customization.  \n",
    "They are typically used in libraries and frameworks to implement domain-specific behavior or enforce constraints at the class level.    \n",
