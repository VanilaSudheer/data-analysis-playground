    "# Python Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Python tutorial! This tutorial is designed to introduce you to the basics of Python programming language. Whether you're completely new to programming or looking to refresh your Python skills, you're in the right place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in various domains including web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Guido van Rossum started working on Python in the late 1980s, and the first version of CPython, Python 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. Since then, Guido van Rossum has been the primary author and maintainer of CPython for many years, overseeing its development and evolution into one of the most popular programming languages in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython continues to be developed and maintained by a community of contributors, with Guido van Rossum's guidance and involvement. It serves as the basis for the Python language specification and is the version of Python most commonly used by developers for building applications, libraries, and frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Python's success can be attributed to its simplicity, readability, versatility, and active community, making it a preferred language for both beginners and professionals in the world of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin our Python journey, let's start with some basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Hello, World!\n",
    "Let's start with the traditional \"Hello, World!\" program to print a message to the console.\n",

    "In Python, variables are used to store data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types in Python refer to the classification of data items, indicating the kind of value that a variable can hold.\n",
    "Python has several built-in data types such as int, float, str, bool\n",
